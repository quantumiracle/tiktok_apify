## How It Works

This tool uses a hybrid approach with two Apify APIs:
1. **TikTok Scraper API** for topic-based searching
2. **TikTok Profile Scraper API** for detailed profile metrics

The process:
1. Searches for TikTok users associated with your specified hashtags
2. Retrieves detailed profile information (followers, likes, bio, etc.)
3. Optionally filters for profiles containing email addresses
4. Provides results as a downloadable CSV file

## Getting an Apify API Token

1. Create an account on [Apify](https://apify.com/)
2. Go to [Account Settings â†’ Integrations](https://console.apify.com/settings/integrations)
3. Generate a new API token
4. Copy and paste the token into the app

## Output Data

The CSV output includes the following data for each profile:
- Username
- Profile URL
- Follower Count
- Total Likes
- Following Count
- Friends Count
- Video Count
- Bio Text
- Email (if available)
- Topic/Hashtag

## Note on Usage Costs

Using the Apify APIs incurs costs of approximately $3-4 per 1000 items. Please be mindful of your usage.
