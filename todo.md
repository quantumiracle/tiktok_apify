# TikTok Parser Development Tasks (API Approach)

## Research Phase
- [x] Research TikTok API services (Apify) and MCP options
- [x] Conclude that Apify TikTok Scraper API is the preferred approach

## Evaluation Phase
- [x] Evaluate Apify TikTok Scraper API input schema and parameters
- [x] Evaluate Apify TikTok Scraper API output fields (check for username, URL, followers, likes, bio, email)
- [x] Confirm feasibility of topic search and email filtering via API

## Design Phase
- [x] Design API-based parser architecture
- [x] Define data handling and processing steps for API results

## Implementation Phase
- [x] Set up project structure for API client usage (Installed apify-client)
- [x] Implement API integration for topic search (ConfigManager, ApiClient, TopicProcessor)
- [x] Implement influencer data extraction from API response (ProfileProcessor, DataProcessor)
- [x] Implement email filtering based on API data (EmailExtractor, DataFilter)
- [x] Implement data export functionality (DataExporter)

## Testing Phase
- [x] Test API-based parser with sample topics (using user API key)
- [x] Verify data accuracy from API results (Test successful for 'art' topic)
- [x] Test email filtering functionality (Verified during test)

## Documentation Phase
- [x] Update documentation for the API-based approach (Created usage_guide.md)
- [ ] Update usage guide with API key instructions and examples (Done within usage_guide.md)
- [ ] Update README.md

## Delivery Phase
- [ ] Package final API-based code
- [ ] Deliver solution to user
